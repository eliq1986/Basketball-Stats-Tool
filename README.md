# Basketball Team Stats Tool

This project illustrates the use of differnt **Python** data types. This project imports multiple files into one file **app.py**

You can run the program by running **python3 app.py** in the terminal. The program will then take the user to the main menu. During this time the program will continuously run and prompt the user for a response. If the user doesn't enter a valid response the program will not crash and ask the user for another response.
